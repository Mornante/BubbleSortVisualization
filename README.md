# Bubble Sort Visualization

Thank you for visiting :)

# Project Overview

This project is a simple Windows Forms application designed to visualize the sorting of a list of numbers in both ascending and descending order. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input a series of numbers.

Once the numbers are entered, users can choose their preferred sorting method—either ascending or descending—by clicking a button. The application then demonstrates how it can organize the data. As the sorting process unfolds, the application visually represents the changes in the list, allowing users to see the step-by-step progression of the sorting action.

# What to Expect

Projects like this was an integral part of my learnings in software development in general. This repository captures an important phase in my journey as a software developer. So you can expect the following:

### Code Quality:
The code here is a testament to my early programming skills. You may encounter numerous bugs, terrible inefficiencies, and less-than-ideal coding practices that were part of my learning curve.

### Learning Journey:
This project was more about the journey than the destination. It helped me understand the basics of software development and laid the foundation for the skills I have today.

### Nostalgia:
While this project may no longer be relevant, it’s a personal reminder of where I began. It’s a piece of my history that I keep as a benchmark of my progress as a software developer.

# Why This Project is Archived
This project is in an archived state and is no longer being actively maintained or updated. I’ve chosen to preserve it in its original form as a record of my growth as a developer. It’s a snapshot of a time when I was still finding my footing in the world of coding.

# Final Thoughts
I hope you find value in exploring this codebase, even if it’s just to see how far one can come from humble beginnings. And if you don't find value in this project I hope it brings a smile to your face as you find many.... many.... cringe worthy practices.

This project may be frozen in time, but the lessons I learned from it continue to influence my work today.
